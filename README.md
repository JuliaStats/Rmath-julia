Rmath-julia
===========

[![AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/abe27g810i5ep6aq/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/simonbyrne/rmath-julia/branch/master)
[![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaStats/Rmath-julia.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaStats/Rmath-julia)

This is a slightly modified version of the [standalone Rmath library from R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#The-standalone-Rmath-library), built to be
used with the [Rmath.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Rmath.jl) Julia package.

The main difference is that it is built to allow defining custom random number generating
functions via C function pointers (see `include/callback.h`). When using the library,
these should be defined before calling any of the random functions.

Build instructions
------------------

Rmath-julia requires GNU Make (https://www.gnu.org/software/make). Just run
`make` to compile the library.

Updating
--------

To update to the latest version of R, bump the `RVERSION` file, and run `make
update`. Some additional manual changes to the headers may be necessary: these should go
in `include/Rconfig.h` (this would typically be generated by autotools, but we try to
simplify the build process).
